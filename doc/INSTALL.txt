Requirements:
 Google re2 regex engine:
        hg clone https://re2.googlecode.com/hg re2
        cd re2
        make test
        make install
        make testinstall

Banjax is using automake frame work, to make and install banjax, cd into banjax directory, assuming that the plugin directory of the traffic server is
       /usr/local/trafficserver/modules
invoke following sequences of command

       libtoolize
       aclocal
       automake --add-missing
       autoconf
       ./configure --libdir=/usr/local/trafficserver/modules
       make
       make install

HACK:
if configure complains that libre2 isn't there but you are sure 
you have already installed it, then

	cp libre2.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/

Debugging:
 If you would like to debug banjax in gdb you need to configure it as follow:
       ./configure --libdir=/usr/local/trafficserver/modules CXXFLAGS="-g2 -O0"

You also need google test framework to be installed

wget http://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.7.0.zip:
unzip gtest-1.7.0.zip
cd gtest-1.7.0
./configure
make
cp lib/.lib/libgtest*.a /usr/lib
